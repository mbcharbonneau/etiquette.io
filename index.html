			<h1>Wearable Etiquette</h1>
			<h3 class="tagline">An illustrated guide for new technology.</h3>
						
			<h2 class="red">Smartwatch</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Don't make others think you have somewhere to be. Avoid <strong>checking notifications</strong> while talking with a friend, waiting for the cashier, or similar situations.</li>
				<li>It's often more appropriate to <strong>wait and look at notifications on your phone</strong>, rather than look at them immediately on your watch.</li>
				<li>Talking to your smartwatch may make friends and strangers think you're addressing them. <strong>Only speak a command if you're alone</strong>, or after explaining what you're doing.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="green">Fitness Tracker</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Your fitness tracker should match the occasion. Some designs are appropriate for formal <strong>business dress</strong>, some for <strong>sports or exercise</strong>. A few may be suitable for both.</li>
				<li><strong>Don't frequently check your fitness tracker's display</strong> while chatting or walking with others. An exception may be made if you are using it to encourage others during a workout.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="purple">Smartphone</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>When organizing plans at a bar or restaurant, place your phone on the table. Your friends who have already arrived will feel included when your receive a message from others in your group.</li>
				<li>Consider how important your conversation is before checking a notification on your phone. Either <strong>wait until later to check</strong>, or wait until a pause in conversation.</li>
				<li>Turn off notification sounds unless you're alone. They may disturb others around you.</li>
				<li>The restaurant is <a href="http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/rnr/4562386373.html">not a proper place to use your phone</a>. Wait until after you leave to check your messages or make a call.</li>
