			<h1>Wearable Etiquette</h1>
			<h3>An illustrated guide for new technology.</h3>
			<h2>Smartwatch</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Don't make others think you have somewhere to be. Avoid checking notifications while talking with a friend, waiting for a cashier, or in similar situations.</li>
				<li>It may be more appropriate to look at notifications on your phone, instead of on your watch.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Fitness Tracker</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Don't frequently check your fitness tracker's display while chatting or walking with others.</li>
				<li>Your fitness tracker should match the occasion. Some designs are appropriate for formal business dress, some for sports or exercise. A few may be suitable for both.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Smartphone</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>When waiting for people to arrive at a bar or restaurant, leave your phone out on the table. Your friends who are already there will feel included when they text.</li>
				<li>Wait until a pause in conversation before checking a notification on your phone. If the conversation is important, do not check it at all.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Google Glass</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Don't wear your Google Glass in public places.</li>
				<li>&hellip;especially at bars or <a href="http://drafthouse.com">movie theaters</a> that explicitly disallow them.</li>
				<li>Wear your Google Glass while biking, skiing, or during other sports.</li>
				<li>If you have a disability, it may be appropriate to wear your Google Glass in other contexts.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Drone</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Do not fly your drone close to people, pets or livestock.</li>
				<li>Be conscious of other's privacy when flying your drone. Don't fly in areas where you might make someone uncomfortable.</li>
				<li>Get permission from event organizers before flying your drone at races and sporting events.</li>
				<li>Check <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/drone/no-fly/">the map</a> before flying your drone.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Virtual Reality Headset</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Remove your VR headset to acknowledge when someone enters the room.</li>
			</ul>
