			<h1>Wearable Etiquette</h1>
			<h3>An illustrated guide for new technology.</h3>
			<h2>Smartwatch</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Don't check your notifications when talking with others, standing in line, or other situations where it would be rude to look at a "dumb" watch.</li>
				<li>If you think a notification is important, it may be more suitable to pause and check your phone so others know what you're doing.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Fitness Tracker</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>It's rude to check your fitness tracker's display when chatting or walking with others.</li>
				<li>Your fitness tracker should match the occasion. Some designs are appropriate for formal business dress, some for sports or exercise, and some for both.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Smartphone</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>When you're waiting for people to arrive at a bar or restaurant, leave your phone out on the table. Your friends who are already there will feel included when they text.</li>
				<li>Do not check your phone while talking with someone else. If you are expecting an important notification, wait until a pause in the conversation to check it.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Google Glass</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Don't wear your Google Glass in public situations.</li>
				<li>&hellip;especially at bars or movie theaters that explicitly disallow them.</li>
				<li>Wear your Google Glass while biking, skiing, or other sports.</li>
				<li>If you have a disability, it may be appropriate to wear your Google Glass in more situations.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Drone</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Do not fly your drone close to other people, pets or livestock.</li>
				<li>Avoid flying near houses and land where someone would normally have an expectation of privacy.</li>
				<li>Get permission before flying your drone at races and sporting events.</li>
				<li>Check <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/drone/no-fly/">the map</a> before flying your drone.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Virtual Reality Headset</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Remove your VR headset to acknowledge when someone enters the room.</li>
			</ul>
