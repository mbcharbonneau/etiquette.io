			<h1>Wearable Etiquette</h1>
			<h3 class="tagline">An illustrated guide for new technology.</h3>
						
			<h2>Smartwatch</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Don't make others think you have somewhere to be. Avoid checking notifications while talking with a friend, waiting for the cashier, and similar situations.</li>
				<li>When you do check your notifications, it may be more appropriate to look at notifications on your phone, rather than your watch.</li>
				<li>Talking to your smartwatch may make friends and strangers think you're addressing them. Only speak a command if you're alone, or after explaining what you're doing.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Fitness Tracker</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Your fitness tracker should match the occasion. Some designs are appropriate for formal business dress, some for sports or exercise. A few may be suitable for both.</li>
				<li>Don't frequently check your fitness tracker's display while chatting or walking with others. An exception may be made if you are using it to encourage others during a workout.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Smartphone</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>When organizing plans at a bar or restaurant, place your phone on the table. Your friends who have already arrived will feel included when your receive a message from others in your group.</li>
				<li>Consider how important your conversation is before checking a notification on your phone. Either wait until later to check, or wait until a pause in conversation.</li>
				<li>Turn off notification sounds unless you're alone. They may disturb others around you.</li>
			</ul>

				<li>Wear your Google Glass while biking, skiing, or during other sports.</li>
				<li>Always remove your Google Glass before entering a public restroom.</li>
